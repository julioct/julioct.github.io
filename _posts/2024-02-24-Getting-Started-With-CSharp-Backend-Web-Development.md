*Read time: 1 minute*

Today I'd like to share with you my brand-new [​ASP.NET Core Full Course For Beginners​](https://youtu.be/AhAxLiGC7Pc){:target="_blank"}:

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AhAxLiGC7Pc?si=4biXj0F9VKxetPlx" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

It's free and it's the best way to get started with **C# Backend Web Development**.  

It takes you from zero to a fully working web application backend using ​ASP.NET​ Core and C#, covering:

* Getting started with ​ASP.NET​ Core
* Understanding REST APIs
* Implementing CRUD endpoints
* Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
* Extension methods
* Route groups
* Handling invalid inputs
* Entity Framework Core
* The .NET configuration system
* Dependency injection
*Service lifetimes
* Entity to DTO mapping
* Asynchronous programming
* Integration with a modern frontend

This course replaces my older [​ASP.NET Core Tutorial for Beginners​](https://youtu.be/bKCzoR01lpE){:target="_blank"}, making it easier to get started with .NET REST API development by using:
* The latest .NET 8 tooling
* The C# Dev Kit
* SQL Lite (as opposed to SQL Server and Docker)
* The minimal amount of code to get the job done

I hope you like it, and stay tuned for an updated Blazor tutorial where you'll learn how to build, step by step, the frontend you'll see at the end of the new course.

Until next week!
