Course 1 of the upcoming [.NET Cloud Developer Bootcamp](https://juliocasal.com/courses/dotnetbootcamp) is now fully recorded!

I had forgotten how intensive that process can be and how many retakes are sometimes needed for the best possible result. In fact, I just finished re-recording the entire 5th module because I didn't like the progression in those lessons. Time-consuming, but it was worth it!

Plus, I've been doing as much editing as possible along the way, having 5 out of 9 modules of this first course all edited by now. So we are pretty close to getting the first course out!

But today I wanted to focus on the 2 questions a few of you have been asking me since I announced this bootcamp: **When can I purchase the bootcamp? What is the price?**

Let's get into that.

​

### **What's the bootcamp price?**
Last week I went through the bootcamp structure and what you'll create along the way. If you missed that, check it out [here]({{ site.url }}/blog/bootcamp-structure-and-what-you-ll-create).

But, in essence, this bootcamp is a multi-course learning path designed to turn C# developers into .NET Cloud developers so you can create production-ready .NET apps for the Azure cloud.

The bootcamp is divided into 9 courses grouped across 3 stages of increased complexity, from beginner-level ASP.NET Core concepts to advanced techniques and patterns used in distributed applications development.

The early bird launch price for this entire bootcamp, including all courses, will be **$247**, and then it will go up to $497 after launch.

Since it will take a few more months to deliver all courses, the bootcamp will stay at the $497 price until the last course is released, at which point the price goes up to $797.

Whatever price at which you purchase the bootcamp, you get lifetime access to all courses, no additional payments required.

​

### **When can I purchase it?**
Ideally, I would not release anything until the entire bootcamp is ready, but since a few of you have been asking me for a way to purchase the included courses now, we will launch with the first course and new courses will become available every month.

So here's the planned release schedule:

**November 7: Bootcamp Early Access**

Exclusive for All-Access Pass holders, Course 1: ASP.NET Core Essentials, will be fully available for them to watch on this day.

**November 12: Bootcamp Launch**

The Early Bird price of $247 becomes available for everyone to purchase. This includes lifetime access to Course 1 and all the other 8 courses at no additional cost.

**November 30: Early Bird Price Ends**

Starting on this date, the bootcamp will be priced at $497. The early bird price won't come back.

**December 10: Course 2 Launch**

Course 2, ASP.NET Core Advanced, becomes available. Anybody that already purchased the bootcamp, and all All-Access Pass holders, get instant access.

**January 7: Course 3 Launch**

Course 3, ASP.NET Core Security, becomes available. Again, all bootcamp owners and All-Access Pass holders, get instant access.

**February 4: Course 4 Launch**

Course 4: Azure Deployment, becomes available for all bootcamp owners and All-Access Pass holders.

​

After course 4, each new course should land on a month-by-month schedule, but I don't want to provide specific dates today since it's a bit hard for me to predict that far.

​

### **Early access for All-Access Pass holders**
As you saw above, All-Access Pass holders will get early access to the bootcamp several days before launch.

This is because their support is invaluable in keeping me going, and I would love to get some good early feedback.

Thank you folks!

​

### **Wrapping Up**
I'm very excited about this new bootcamp and can't wait for folks to start watching all the content.

We are almost there, so bear with me for just a few more days.

Cheers,

Julio
