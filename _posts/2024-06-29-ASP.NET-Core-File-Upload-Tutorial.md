*Read time: 8 minutes*

Today we'll see how to implement file uploads in ASP.NET Core.

Uploading a file as part of a form submission is a common requirement in web applications, so it's important to know how to do it properly.

And the interesting thing is that implementing such a feature goes way beyond just the backend API or the frontend part, which is what most tutorials focus on.

Here I'll cover the whole flow, from the frontend, to the backend API and to Azure Blob Storage, so you can see how all the pieces fit together.

Let's dive in.

<br/>

### **What are we trying to do?**
Here's the scenario: You have a page in your ASP.NET Core application where users can create or update a product, and include an image as part of the product details.

![](/assets/images/tns-40-upload-scenario.jpg)

Specifically, we would like to enable this specific flow:

**1.** The user uses a file picker to select an image file from the machine and clicks the "Save" button

**2.** The browser sends a post request to the Blazor Static SSR frontend that includes the image file

**3.** The Blazor Static SSR frontend sends the image file to the ASP.NET Core backend, where we have an API endpoint ready to receive it

**4.** The ASP.NET Core API receives the image file and uploads it to Azure Blob Storage

Let me quickly tackle a couple of questions you might have:

#### **Why are we not storing the images in the server file system?**

That won't work since we plan on running both backend and frontend in the cloud as Docker containers, which will be scaled and destroyed as needed, causing tons of trouble with anything stored directly in them (we could use volumes, but it would only complicate things).

#### **Why are we not uploading the image directly from the frontend to Azure Blob Storage?**
Because the frontend will be exposed to the public Internet, and we don't want to keep sensitive information like Azure Blob Storage connection strings there.

Also, we want to have a clear separation of concerns, with the frontend only responsible for UI rendering and the backend responsible for all important server-side operations. That way, if we ever decide to change the frontend tech (which happens frequently), we won't have to redo the blob upload logic.

Now let's see how to implement this in 5 quick steps, starting with the backend.

<br/>

### **Step 1: Implement a file uploader service**
Let's start by installing the Azure Blob Storage NuGet package in the backend project:

```bash
dotnet add package Aspire.Azure.Storage.Blobs
```

Notice that this is not the [normal Azure Storage Blobs client](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/overview/azure/storage.blobs-readme){:target="_blank"} package, but instead the [.NET Aspire Blob Storage component](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/storage/azure-storage-blobs-component){:target="_blank"}, which not only makes it easier to register Blob Storage in the application but also provides health checks, logging, and tracing for free.

If you are new to **.NET Aspire**, you may want to check out my [.NET Aspire article]({{ site.url }}/blog/Going-Cloud-Native-With-Dotnet-Aspire) where I explain how to get started with it.

Now we can create a small service to handle the file upload:
    
```csharp
public class FileUploader(BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient)
{
    public async Task<string> UploadImageAsync(IFormFile file, string containerName)
    {
        // Create a blob container if it doesn't exist
        var containerClient = blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient(containerName);
        await containerClient.CreateIfNotExistsAsync(PublicAccessType.Blob);

        // Delete the existing blob if it exists
        var blobClient = containerClient.GetBlobClient(file.FileName);
        await blobClient.DeleteIfExistsAsync();

        // Upload the new blob
        using var fileStream = file.OpenReadStream();
        await blobClient.UploadAsync(
            fileStream,
            new BlobHttpHeaders { ContentType = file.ContentType });

        // Return the URI of the uploaded blob
        return blobClient.Uri.ToString();
    }
}
```

The code should be easy to follow, but let me explain a few things:

* **BlobServiceClient** is the class you can use to interact with Azure Blob Storage. We'll see where and how that class is registered in a bit.

* **IFormFile** is the class that represents the uploaded file. In the next step, we'll see how to define a property of that type in the DTO that our API endpoint will receive.

* **containerName** is the name of the container where the image will be stored. All files in Azure Blob Storage must be stored in a container.

Now, let's add the following lines to **Program.cs** to register the **BlobServiceClient** and our **FileUploader**:

```csharp
builder.AddAzureBlobClient("AzureBlobs");
builder.Services.AddSingleton<FileUploader>();
```

The **AddAzureBlobClient** method is provided by **.NET Aspire** and is the one that registers the **BlobServiceClient** we injected into **FileUploader**. 

The **AzureBlobs** parameter is the name of the connection that defines how to access the Azure Blob Storage account. Where does that connection come from? That's provided by the **.NET Aspire AppHost project**, which we'll cover in **Step 4**.

Now let's move into defining the API endpoint.

<br/>

### **Step 2: Implement the backend API**
Our API endpoint will receive not just the image file, but also all the product details, since users will upload the image as part of the page where products are created.

Let's start by defining the relevant DTO:

```csharp
public record class CreateGameDto(
    string Name,
    int GenreId,
    decimal Price,
    DateOnly ReleaseDate,
    string Description,
    IFormFile ImageFile);
```

Notice the **ImageFile** property, which is of type **IFormFile**. This is the property that will hold the uploaded image file.

Now let's define the API endpoint:

```csharp
app.MapPost("/games", async (
    [FromForm] CreateGameDto newGame,
    CatalogContext dbContext,
    FileUploader fileUploader) =>
{
    // Upload the image to blob storage
    string imageUri = await fileUploader.UploadImageAsync(newGame.ImageFile, "images");

    // Save the game to the DB
    Game game = newGame.ToEntity(imageUri);
    dbContext.Games.Add(game);
    await dbContext.SaveChangesAsync();

    // Return the created game details
    return Results.CreatedAtRoute(
        "GetGame",
        new { id = game.Id },
        game.ToGameDetailsDto());
});
```

A key thing to notice here is the **[FromForm]** attribute in the **newGame** parameter. This attribute tells ASP.NET Core to bind the incoming request into the **CreateGameDto** object by grabbing the properties from the form data.

We have to use the **[FromForm]** attribute because the image file (and everything else in the request) is sent as a form field, not as a JSON payload. Images are binary data, and we can't send them as JSON, which is a text-based format.

Also, we can't mix JSON and form data in the same request, so we have to choose one or the other. In this case, we chose form data because it's the only way to send binary data.

I won't go over the **ToEntity** and **ToGameDetailsDto** methods, since those are simple mapping methods. The important part is that the image URI is saved in the database, so we can use it later to display the image in the frontend.

Now let's move into the frontend side of things.

<br/>

### **Step 3: Implement the frontend Razor component**
The first thing we'll need in our Blazor frontend is some model to hold the product details and the image file:

```csharp
public class GameDetails
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public required string Name { get; set; }
    public string? GenreId { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public DateOnly ReleaseDate { get; set; }
    public required string Description { get; set; }    
    public IFormFile? ImageFile { get; set; }
    public string? ImageUri { get; set; }
}
```

There, **ImageFile** will hold the image selected by the user when creating a game, and **ImageUri** will hold the URI of an initial image we'll use as a placeholder.

Now let's define the [typed HttpClient]({{ site.url }}/blog/ASP.NET-Core-HttpClient-Tutorial) that will know how to prepare the request to send to the backend API:

```csharp
public class GamesClient(HttpClient httpClient)
{
    public async Task AddGameAsync(GameDetails game) => 
        await httpClient.PostAsync("games", ToMultiPartFormDataContent(game));

    public static MultipartFormDataContent ToMultiPartFormDataContent(GameDetails game)
    {
        var formData = new MultipartFormDataContent
        {
            { new StringContent(game.Name), nameof(game.Name) },
            { new StringContent(game.GenreId!), nameof(game.GenreId) },
            { new StringContent(game.Price.ToString()), nameof(game.Price) },
            { new StringContent(game.ReleaseDate.ToString()), nameof(game.ReleaseDate) },
            { new StringContent(game.Description), nameof(game.Description) }
        };
    
        if (game.ImageFile is not null)
        {
            var streamContent = new StreamContent(game.ImageFile.OpenReadStream())
            {
                Headers = { ContentType = new MediaTypeHeaderValue(game.ImageFile.ContentType) }
            };

            formData.Add(streamContent, "ImageFile", game.ImageFile.FileName);
        }
        
        return formData;
    }
}
```

Notice how we can't just send the **GameDetails** object as JSON, since it contains the **IFormFile** property. 

Instead, we have to convert it, property by property, into a **MultipartFormDataContent** object, with some special logic to handle the **ImageFile**.

Now let's see how to use this **GamesClient** in a Razor component. First, the HTML part:

```html{20 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61}
@page "/catalog/editgame"

@inject NavigationManager NavigationManager
@inject GamesClient GamesClient

<PageTitle>@title</PageTitle>
<h3>@title</h3>

@if (game is null)
{
    <p><em>Loading...</em></p>
}
else
{
    <div class="row mb-2">
        <div class="col-md-4">
            <EditForm Model="@game" 
                        FormName="editGame" 
                        OnValidSubmit="HandleSubmitAsync" 
                        enctype="multipart/form-data" 
                        Enhance>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    <label for="name" class="form-label">Name:</label>
                    <InputText id="name" @bind-Value="game.Name" class="form-control" />
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    <label for="genre" class="form-label">Genre:</label>
                    <InputSelect id="genre" @bind-Value="game.GenreId" class="form-select">
                        <option value="">Select a genre</option>
                        <option value="1">Fighting</option>
                        <option value="2">Kids and Family</option>
                        <option value="3">Racing</option>
                    </InputSelect>                                        
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    <label for="description" class="form-label">Description:</label>
                    <InputTextArea id="description" 
                                   @bind-Value="game.Description" 
                                   class="form-control" />
                </div>                
                <div class="mb-3">
                    <label for="price" class="form-label">Price:</label>
                    <InputNumber id="price" @bind-Value="game.Price" class="form-control" />
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    <label for="releaseDate" class="form-label">Release Date:</label>
                    <InputDate id="releaseDate" 
                               @bind-Value="game.ReleaseDate" 
                               class="form-control" />
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                    <label for="imageUri" class="form-label">Image:</label>
                    <input id="imageUri" 
                            type="file" 
                            name="game.ImageFile" 
                            class="form-control" 
                            accept=".png, .jpg, .jpeg" 
                            onchange="previewImage(event)"/>
                    <img id="imagePreview" 
                        src="@game.ImageUri" 
                        class="img-thumbnail mt-2" />
                </div>                     
                <button type="submit" class="btn btn-primary">Save</button>
                <a role="button" class="btn btn-secondary" href="/catalog">Cancel</a>
            </EditForm>
        </div>
    </div>
}
```

Regarding this piece, notice the following:

* You must specify **enctype="multipart/form-data"** in the **EditForm** tag, so the form can send binary data. Otherwise, the **ImageFile** property of the **GameDetails** object will never get populated with the image file!
* The **name** attribute of the **input** tag must match the name of the property in the **GameDetails** object. This is how Blazor binds the uploaded file to the **ImageFile** property.
* **previewImage** is a small javascript function that will show a preview of the image selected by the user in the **img** tag below the file picker. 

Here's the javascript function, which you can define in a separate **.js** file somewhere under the **wwwroot** folder and include in your **App.razor** file:

```javascript
window.previewImage = (event) => {
    var reader = new FileReader();
    reader.onload = function() {
        var output = document.getElementById('imagePreview');
        output.src = reader.result;
    }
    reader.readAsDataURL(event.target.files[0]);
};
```

Now let's add the C# part of our Razor component:

```csharp
@code {
    private const string defaultImageUri = "https://placehold.co/100";

    [SupplyParameterFromForm]
    private GameDetails? game { get; set; }

    private string title = string.Empty;

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        if (game is not null)
        {
            return;
        }

        game = new()
            {
                Name = string.Empty,
                ReleaseDate = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.UtcNow),
                ImageUri = defaultImageUri,
                Description = string.Empty
            };

        title = "New Game";
    }

    private async Task HandleSubmitAsync()
    {
        await GamesClient.AddGameAsync(game);

        NavigationManager.NavigateTo("/catalog");
    }
}
```

Let me break down the code a bit:

* **defaultImageUri** is a placeholder image that will be shown when the user hasn't selected an image yet.
* Using **[SupplyParameterFromForm]** in the **game** property tells Blazor to bind the form data to the **game** object when the user submits the form.
* All we do in the **OnInitialized** method is create a new **GameDetails** object to hold the form data. Just have to check if the **game** object is already populated since Blazor will call this method even when the user submits the form.
* The **HandleSubmitAsync** method is called when the user clicks the "Save" button. It sends the **game** object to the backend API using the **GamesClient**.

My actual Razor component is a bit more complex, with validation logic, error handling, and the ability to handle both creating and editing games. But I hope this simplified version gives you a good idea of how to implement the file upload piece.

Finally, let's see how to connect frontend, backend, and Azure Blob Storage to be able to run the whole thing.

<br/>

### **Step 4: Add .NET Aspire orchestration**
Instead of having to play around with hosts, ports, and storage connection strings, we can use [.NET Aspire Orchestration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/fundamentals/app-host-overview){:target="_blank"} to figure out all the details for us.

I have already covered the details of how to get started with .NET Aspire in my [.NET Aspire article]({{ site.url }}/blog/Going-Cloud-Native-With-Dotnet-Aspire), so here I'll just focus on the **AppHost** project I created for this tutorial.

Here are the contents of the **Program.cs** file in the **AppHost** project:

```csharp{3 4 5 6 7 8 9}
var builder = DistributedApplication.CreateBuilder(args);

var blobs = builder.AddAzureStorage("Storage")
                   .RunAsEmulator(builder =>
                   {
                        builder.WithDataVolume();
                   })
                   .AddBlobs("AzureBlobs");

var catalogApi = builder.AddProject<Projects.Catalog_Api>("catalog-api")
                 .WithReference(blobs);

builder.AddProject<Projects.GameStore_Frontend>("gamestore-frontend")
       .WithReference(catalogApi);

builder.Build().Run();
```

Let's see what's going on with that Azure Blob Storage part:

* **AddAzureStorage** Adds an Azure Storage resource to the application model.
* **RunAsEmulator** Configures an Azure Storage resource to be emulated using the [Azurite container](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-azurite){:target="_blank"}. That way, we can run the application locally without having to connect to a real Azure Storage account.
* **AddBlobs** Adds a Blob Storage resource to the Azure Storage resource and makes the connection details available to any resource that references it via the **AzureBlobs** connection name. Remember that we used this name when calling **AddAzureBlobClient** in the backend API project.
* By calling **WithReference(blobs)** in the **catalogApi** project, we make sure that the **AzureBlobs** connection details are available to the backend API project.

<br/>

### **Step 5: Run it!**
After running the **AppHost** project, let's navigate to the **Edit** page in the frontend. Things will look like this just before the user submits the form:

![](/assets/images/tns-40-edit-page.jpg)

And, after saving changes, you should be able to see the image uploaded to the **Azurite** emulator, here via the [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/storage-explorer){:target="_blank"}:

![](/assets/images/tns-40-azurite.jpg)

Mission accomplished!
